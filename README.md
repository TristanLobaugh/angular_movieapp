# Hacker Track Week 13

### Rewrote the movie app using Angular. 
Update the search bar so that when the user types an entry, AJAX will check (after at least 3 characters), for an exact match to movie title or actor name. If an exact match is made, populate it as an option that the user can click on (make it blue or some other color) and take them to that element's page, instead of searching for matching titles with that one at the top.
If a partial search terms (such as “brad”) returns a variety of options, put “in actors” or “in movies” next to it in the suggest section. See Amazon - search for ‘razor’. You are after the part in orange.


## Summary

#### Wrote using AngularJS, Bootstrap, Compass, Jquery and native javascript.
